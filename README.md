# Coupon-Recommendation-System-Using-CATBOOST-Algorithm
Hi all, This is my Capstone project on Coupon Recommendation System. 
The goal of the Coupon Recommendation System project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a user will accept a coupon offer, based on their personal attributes, lifestyle habits, and driving context.

Business Impact: Helps optimize targeted promotions and improve redemption rates.
